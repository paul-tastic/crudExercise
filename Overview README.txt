This project is a full stack solution that does the following:

1. Creates a database, and user table with example fields (username, password, first name, last name).
2. Creates a REST API to perform CRUD functions in the MySQL table.
3. Creates a front end for the CRUD functions for the user to interact.

NOTES:
1. This project uses PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery only.
2. It doesn't use an MVC or an accompanying ORM, although the case could certainly be made for it's benefits.
3. I used named placeholders in the queries to prevent injection attacks, but did not do any data validation other than what HTML5 provides.
4. I am not hashing/encrypting passwords for this exercise (nor any data).
5. I am not including any type of user authorization.
6. Recommend using bootstrap for the formatting, mobile support, and general cleaner look.
7. I used jQuery for ease of integration of document manipulation and AJAX functions.
8. Something like this I would recommend a plug in for table formatting, like ag-grid.

Anyway, it was a fun exercise!
